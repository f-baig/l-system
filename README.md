# l-system

**Current code simply generates a fractal visualized using SFML based on a set of recursive production guidelines.**

The following project is a quick exploration utilizing C++, SFML, and a Lindermayer system. Inspired by [Pezzza's](https://github.com/johnBuffer) great [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esX-19-sVyY&list=LL&index=1) I found while scrolling on YouTube. 

To modify the Lindenmayer axiom and rules, you can edit the create_production function.

Added functionalities: sway of branch depending on distance from root, wind physics
